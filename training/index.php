<h3 class="red underline">Cancelled: Keyman Developer Training - Basel, Switzerland, February 2020</h3>
<p>
Due to insufficient numbers, we have cancelled this workshop. We will continue to look at ways to make this training available
and will provide updates via the Keyman mailing list and website.  We hope that in the near future we will be able to provide
the training you need in a way that you can take advantage of.</p>

<p>
In the meantime, please do contact us if we can be of any assistance.
