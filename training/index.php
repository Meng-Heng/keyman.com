<h3 class="red underline">Online Keyman Developer Training Workshop - 24-28 February, 2020</h3>

<p><a class='generic-cta-button' href='https://intre.org?487' target='_blank'>Register Now!</a></p>

<p>We are hosting an Online Keyman Developer Training Workshop the week of February 24-28. We will teach you how to create powerful
multi-platform keyboard layouts for desktop and mobile devices. By the end of the week, you will have a working keyboard layout
for your language(s) ready to share with the world.</p>

<p>To allow for a maximum range of participants from many time zones, we are only doing two hours of workshop each day, from 12:00-14:00 UTC.
For those in the US, this will be early morning, after which they can spend the needed time working on their keyboard assignment.  For others,
it will fall in the evening, and they can spend the following day doing their assignment before the next group session.  We will have support
staff in various time zones standing by to help participants if needed.</p>

<p>The cost is $30 which must be paid by credit card at our <a href='https://intre.org?487' target='_blank'>registration site</a>.
The payment confirmation email will contain a link to register for the Zoom webinar, which will send you reminders as the day approaches.</p>
